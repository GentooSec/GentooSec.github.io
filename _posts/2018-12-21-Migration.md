This is a small post to analyze migrations using a package called [**migest**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/migest/index.html), this is simply to provide methods for indirect estimation of bilateral migration. It is no secret that Venezuelan migration is not a problem in that country. The good thing about this package is that it has an example, which we will show below:
The first thing is to start loading our libraries and then we generate the demo

~~~R
library("migest")
demo(cfplot_reg, package = "migest", ask = FALSE)
~~~
Generating the following circular plot

Now to work with real data, for them we will use one of the many sources that exist, for example [**IRIS**](https://www.irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-migration-data-2015-2016)

It is a pretty complete and nice example, although we can do it in a more personalized way. Playing with all the options that it has. In our case alone we will use a few data of sample and also we could use alone Latin America or some specific continent that we wanted, but in order that it is better visualized we will use the complete dataset.

~~~R
uno <- read.csv(system.file("vidwp", "reg_flow.csv", package = "migest"), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
dos <- read.csv(system.file("vidwp", "reg_plot.csv", package = "migest"), stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

chordDiagram(x = uno)

It is important to mention that our cvs data are:

~~~R
